## What is Ponder ?
Ponder is a decentralized matchmaking platform. It allows introductions between people
to be made at scale. Using game mechanics and financial rewards Ponder motivates
everyone to play matchmaker for friends and strangers alike. Ponders vision is to be the goto
place for meeting new people in all contexts where trust is critical – dating, recruiting,
business partnerships, roommates, babysitting etc. 

## How can Ponder Token add value ?
There is a clear transfer of value between the ‘matchmakers’ and the ‘matchees’. Ponder token can
be given by the latter (Matchee) to pay the former for the value they’ve created. Having this token on the Ethereum blockchain allows users greater flexibility than if the token was a currency within the Ponder app alone.
